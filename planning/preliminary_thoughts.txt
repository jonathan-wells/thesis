What papers have you written or contributed to?

    1. Co-translational assembly of protein complexes
    2. Operon gene order is optimized for ordered protein complex assembly
    3. Global quantification of cellular protein degradation kinetics
    4. Hawk proteins point to the last eukaryotic ancestor of Smc-kleisins

What am I currently working on or likely to look at in the next year?

    1. Another co-translational assembly review
    2. Aneuploidy and how it relates to protein complexes
    3. Transcription factor binding and regulation of protein complexes
    4. Distribution of proteins on chromosomes

What are the key points you would like to get across?

    1. Proteins animate life. There are many genes, but not nearly enough to
       account for the complexity we see in life. Some back of the envelope
       calculations demonstrate the number of possible binary interactions.
       This alone is an oversimplification - proteins form complexes.
    2. We work on what's tractable - until very recently the state of proteomics
       was not sufficiently advanced to be able to make good quality
       measurements. Similarly structural data was also lacking. We now have the
       ability to work with lots of data and make progress.
